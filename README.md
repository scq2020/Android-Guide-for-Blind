We presents an Android-based SLAM intelligent guide system for the visually impaired, integrating advanced visual SLAM technology with multimodal human-computer interaction to provide safe and accurate indoor navigation services. The system employs optimized SLAM algorithms with enhanced feature extraction for navigation-critical areas, intelligent path planning using improved A* search strategies combined with Douglas-Peucker simplification, and context-aware voice guidance with tactile feedback. Key innovations include dual-mode adaptive map management supporting real-time grid map construction and navigation mode switching, target point attraction algorithms for unreachable destinations, and complete mobile terminal independence without requiring external servers or network connectivity. The system achieves real-time processing while maintaining excellent obstacle detection capabilities and responsive voice instruction delivery. Compared to existing solutions requiring cloud support or specialized infrastructure, our system operates entirely on standard smartphones, ensuring privacy protection and deployment flexibility. The proposed approach addresses critical challenges in assistive navigation technology by providing reliable indoor positioning, intelligent route planning, and intuitive human-machine interaction specifically designed for visually impaired users.
